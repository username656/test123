# REST Integration API for AlertFind MessageOne

We design our interface following common expected behavior that we will just document once and follow all across the
API without exception.

We follow the [REST API naming best practices](http://www.restapitutorial.com/lessons/restfulresourcenaming.html), the [HTTP method definition best practices](http://www.restapitutorial.com/lessons/httpmethods.html) according to the [REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) definition.

The following is brief extract of particular pattern used:

HTTP Verb | CRUD           | Entire Collection (e.g. /customers)
--------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
POST	  | Create         | 201 (Created), 'Location' header with link to /customers/{id} containing new ID.
GET	      | Read           | 200 (OK), list of customers. Use pagination, sorting and filtering to navigate big lists.
PUT	      | Update/Replace | 405 (Method Not Allowed).
PATCH	  | Update/Modify  | 405 (Method Not Allowed).
DELETE	  | Delete         | 405 (Method Not Allowed).

----------------

HTTP Verb | CRUD                     | Specific Item (e.g. /customers/{id})
--------- | ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------
POST	  | Create                   | 404 (Not Found), 409 (Conflict) if resource already exists.
GET	      | Read                     | 200 (OK), single customer. 404 (Not Found), if ID not found or invalid.
PUT	      | Update (entire resource) | 200 (OK) or 204 (No Content). 404 (Not Found), if ID not found or invalid.
PATCH	  | Modify (resource fields) | 200 (OK) or 204 (No Content). 404 (Not Found), if ID not found or invalid.
DELETE	  | Delete                   | 200 (OK). 404 (Not Found), if ID not found or invalid.
